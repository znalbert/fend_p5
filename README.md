# Neighborhood Map Project [link](https://znalbert.github.io/fend_p5)

This is the beginnings of a project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. In this project I am to use Knockout.js, Google Maps, and an external API to create an interactive map that displays a filterable list of locations and the ability to select locations to see more information or media relating to the selected place.
